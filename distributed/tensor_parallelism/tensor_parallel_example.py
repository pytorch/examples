"""
This is the script to test Tensor Parallel(TP) on a toy model in a
Megetron-LM SPMD style. We show an E2E working flow from forward,
backward and optimization.

More context about API designs can be found in the design:

https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/89884.

And it is built on top of Distributed Tensor which is proposed in:

https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/88838.

We use the example of two `nn.Linear` layers with an element-wise `nn.RELU`
in between to show an example of Megatron-LM, which was proposed in paper:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08053.

The basic idea is that we parallelize the first linear layer by column
and also parallelize the second linear layer by row so that we only need
one all reduce in the end of the second linear layer.

We can speed up the model training by avoiding communications between
two layers.

To parallelize a nn module, we need to specify what parallel style we want
to use and our `parallelize_module` API will parse and parallelize the modules
based on the given `ParallelStyle`. We are using this PyTorch native Tensor
Parallelism APIs in this example to show users how to use them.
