# FX Examples

This folder contains several examples of program transformations implemented using `torch.fx`. More information about FX can be found in the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/fx.html).

Note that all examples should be runnable as standalone Python files. In the case of an exception, the example will appear in a subfolder with a `README.md` file explaining how to run the example.

As FX is currently in a Beta release, the API or these examples are subject to change.
