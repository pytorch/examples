# Sentence Classification tutorial with the PyTorch c++ Frontend
This folder contains an example of training a Convolutional Neural Network for sentence classification on TREC dataset, using the PyTorch C++ frontend.

The code is split into 2 folders:

```src``` folder contains the files ```datautils.cpp``` and ```sentence_classification.cpp```

```include``` folder contains the files ```datautils.h```, ```loader.h```, ```model.h``` and ```trainmodel.h```

To build the code, run the following commands from your terminal:
```
$ cd sentence_classification
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/libtorch ..
$ make
```
where ```/path/to/libtorch``` should be the path to the unzipped LibTorch distribution, which you can get from the [PyTorch homepage](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Execute the compiled binary to train the model:
```
./sentence_classification
