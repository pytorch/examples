# Custom Dataset Example with the PyTorch C++ Frontend

This folder contains an example of loading a custom image dataset with OpenCV and training a model to label images, using the PyTorch C++ frontend.

The dataset used here is [Caltech 101](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/) dataset.

The entire training code is contained in custom-data.cpp.

You can find instructions on how to install OpenCV [here](../tools/InstallingOpenCV.md).

To build the code, run the following commands from your terminal:

```shell
$ cd custom-dataset
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/libtorch ..
$ make
```

where /path/to/libtorch should be the path to the unzipped LibTorch distribution, which you can get from the [PyTorch homepage](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

if you see an error like `undefined reference to cv::imread(std::string const&, int)` when running the `make` command, you should build LibTorch from source using the instructions [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source), and then set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to that PyTorch source directory.

The build directory should look like this:

```
.
├── custom-dataset
├── dataset
│   ├── accordion
│   │   ├── image_0001.jpg
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── airplanes
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── ...
├── info.txt
└── Makefile
└── ...
```

`info.txt` file gets copied from source directory during build.

Execute the compiled binary to train the model:

```shell
./custom-dataset
